# Overview

## Design

This project is focused on rapid iteration and continuous deployment, far above the viability of the application as a 'product' or your team as a potential start-up.

Your teams have been assigned (see below). You will work with your team to generate project ideas, delegate roles, and build something awesome.

In a real work environment, you'll rarely have the opportunity to choose all of the people you collaborate with. Your success as an engineer will, in large part, be determined by how well you're able to integrate with varied groups of engineers. The ability to contribute to a shared vision and iterate towards it effectively among peers is extremely valuable. This sprint will help you hone that skill.

### Greenfield Learning Objectives:

- **Project Documentation**
- **Group Dynamics and Collaboration**
- **Product Implementation**
- **Project Architecture**
- **Product Design**

During the greenfield project, you must document your code, syntax styling, git workflow, and feature roadmap in sufficient detail so that it can be handed to an arbitrary team with virtually no explanation.

This repo contains templates that you'll use as a guide to successfully document and structure your project on GitHub. As you begin your project, you'll copy over the templates into a brand-new repo (public) you'll create as part of the process described below -- DO NOT DO THAT YET (follow the steps).

## Steps to Follow

1. Start by checking the Figma model that you will follow.
2. One of the team members must create a new GitHub Organization account for your team using your codename. Using a GitHub organization ensures that all members share equally in the glory of the project.
3. Add all your teammates as members of the new organization.
4. Create a new project repo (same name as the organization) in your new organization.

## Features to Implement
